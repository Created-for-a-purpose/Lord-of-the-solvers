# Lord-of-the-solvers
Introducing an innovative tool powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) designed to revolutionize the way we solve intents. At its core, this tool understands user intents, deciphering the desired outcomes, whether it's swapping tokens or acquiring specific NFTs.

Solvers, the backbone of this system, efficiently pick transactions aligned with user intents. Their mission is clear: to help users save valuable time and steer clear of potential frustrations. Imagine a seamless experience reminiscent of Web2, made even better with the help of account abstraction, where solving intents becomes a breeze.

However, traditional solvers pose challenges, particularly in terms of user privacy. Intentions are laid bare, exposing users to potential risks such as frontrunning and MEV attacks. Our FHE-powered solution addresses these concerns, ensuring a secure and private environment for users to navigate their intentions without compromising confidentiality. Welcome to the future of intent-solving, where privacy and efficiency coexist harmoniously.
